# endogenous_bci_platform
The Following platform describes the Matlab/Simulink platform designed for real time implementation of 
Endogenous Brain Computer Interfaces.

It comprises:
1. Simulink models responsible for the signal processing of the EEG signals (slx files)
2. An optional JAVA platform that interfaces with the Simulink models and provides a GUI interface to control a computer cursor(zip file)
3. A video media file that shows a computer cursor run of a subject in an experiment performed using the platform (.wmv)
4. A folder containing datasets for six session experiments of computer cursor control using motor imagery (SMR-based BCI) in which five  subjects participated ( mat files and csv files)
5. A pdf file that explains the structure of the datasets provived
